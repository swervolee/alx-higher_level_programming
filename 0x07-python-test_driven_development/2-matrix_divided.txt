Dividing a matrix by 2:
>>> matrix_divide([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Trying to divide the matris by 0:
>>> matrix_divide([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Trying to divide by a float number:
>>> matrix_divide([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 1.5)
[[0.67, 1.33, 2.0], [2.67, 3.33, 4.0]]

Trying to divide an empty matrix:
matrix_divide([[1, 2, 3], []], 5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Trying to give a tuple instead of a matrix:
>>> matrix_divide((1, 2, 3), 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Trying with a matrix whose elemets are of different sizes
>>> matrix_divide([[1, 2, 4], [1, 2]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size


Trying to give a matrix of strings:
>>> matrix_divide([["hi", "hello"], ["how", "today"]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Trying to put put string numerals:
>>> matrix_divide([["1", "2"], ["3", "4"]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Trying to test  a mix of number and strings:
>>> matrix_divide([[1, "3"], ["2", 4]], 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Trying to test a matrix where one of the elements is empty
>>> matrix_divide([[2, 3], []], 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing a matrix which one of the elements is a tuple
>>> matrix_divide([[3, 4], (3, 5)], 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


Testing the case where the div is a list
>>> matrix_divide([[1, 2], [2, 4]], [1, 2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

Testing where div is a string
>>> matrix_divide([[2, 3], [4, 5]], "8")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: div must be a number


Dividing with a matrix which contains negative numbers
>>> matrix_divide([[-4, 5], [3, -6]], 2)
[[-2.0, 2.5], [1.5, -3.0]]
