#                    Classes and Objects

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes.

Classes can have attributes, which are data stored on the object, and methods, which are functions that are associated with the object.

To create a class, you use the class keyword. The following code creates a class called Person:
Python
```
class Person:
    name = ""
    age = 0
```

This class has two attributes: name and age.

To create an object from a class, you use the () operator. The following code creates an object called p from the Person class:

p = Person()


You can access the attributes of an object using the dot notation. The following code prints the name of the p object:
Python

print(p.name)


You can also call the methods of an object using the dot notation. The following code calls the get_age() method of the p object:
Python

p.get_age()

Here is a more detailed explanation of classes and objects in Python:

###    Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that all objects of that class will have.

Classes are defined using the class keyword. The following code defines a class called Person:
Python
```
class Person:
    name = ""
    age = 0
```

This class has two attributes: name and age.

###    Objects

An object is an instance of a class. It has the attributes and methods that are defined in its class.

Objects are created using the () operator. The following code creates an object called p from the Person class:
Python

p = Person()


The p object has the attributes name and age, which are defined in the Person class.

###    Attributes

Attributes are data that is stored on an object. They are defined in the class definition.

The following code defines an attribute called name in the Person class:
Python

```
class Person:
    name = ""
```

The name attribute can be accessed using the dot notation. The following code prints the value of the name attribute of the p object:
Python

print(p.name)


###    Methods

Methods are functions that are associated with an object. They are defined in the class definition.

The following code defines a method called get_age() in the Person class:
Python

class Person:
    name = ""
    age = 0

    def get_age(self):
        return self.age


The get_age() method can be called using the dot notation. The following code calls the get_age() method of the p object:
Python

p.get_age()

This code will print the value of the age attribute of the p object.
